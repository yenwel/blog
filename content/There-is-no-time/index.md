# "There is no time for that".

Whatever role you are in as a technical person you are usually in a context where you are a cost center to an organization on a budget in the public sector or with a profit goal in the private sector. The only profit center for a company is possibly maybe even only a paying customer according to Peter Drucker. Or a satisfied taxpayer if you are in the public sector.  Not everyone works at a FAANG where you have the privilige to spend 20% on your time on "n'importe quoi" be it a hobby project or some necessary improvement. Sometimes from your expert point of view you can identify certain improvements that think would benefit your organization and maybe also look good on your CV. Usually you are however managed at a some higher level by somebody who does not understand or zones out when you start talking about software architecture and coding. Unless you are a solo start-up founder and then the following is still relevant knowledge to have if you want to keep you business from running up high costs. When you are in a constrained environment you can use the following technique to negotiate budget or budgetted time to be spent on a necessary technical improvements. You may however work under a manager who has read the lean start-up and thinks technical debt does not exists although he's not in the position of just selling a start-up when technical debt has acrued. In that case I have only pity for you.

## Background: lean cost calculation

Usually we are working teams where agile methodologies are used like Scrum or Kanban. These methodologies have it's roots in lean manufacturing. Software development is knowledge work and also with a lot of unknowns because of reasons like social and orginizational interactions. That's why deeply quantitative methods or calculations for extensive planning is quite taboo as opposition to the waterfall software methodology. We mostly use the methodology of kanban by using story points or t-shirts sizes that have no direct link to quantities of time. Kanban has it's origin in a three-bin system or other physical tokens which were added to halfproducts for a workstation and the return of physical token to the stock was a trigger to replenish that workstation. These tokens were an indirect way to measure the physical flow of materials. 

### Kaizen event

Another tool in the toolbox of lean manufacturing is the Kaizen event. The purpose of this not to monitor the stability of quality continuously but rather it is literally a focused event to literally improve your process dramatically in a short timespan. In manufacturing environment this could be a shopfloor or warehouse manager focusing one certain operation in collaboration with the operators on the floor. This is done in a single DMAIC cycle. This has differnt steps where you Define your objective to improve on, Measure an indicator for that objective, Analyze this measuement, Improve on this indicator and Control for this improvement. 

Another concept that is helpfull here is looking at wastes or muda in your process that could be useful in choosing a metric for the measurement phase. For manufacturing muda are classified under the mnemonic TIMWOODS which stands for Transportation, Inventory, Motion, Waiting, Overproduction, Over processing, Defects and Skills.

To define your metric it is possible to do back of the envelloppe calculations to estimate

## Simple example: I need a new keyboard,

## More elaborate example: The entire floor is waiting for the error you made in the configuration.
