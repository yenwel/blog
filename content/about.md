Hi I'm Jan Vandepitte and professionally I'm working as a data engineering consultant. In my free time I like to work on artistic pursuits like stone masonry, sculptures, drawing, homesteading (keeping chickens and gardening) and spending time with my family.

I have a background in bio-science engineering with additional education in IT and big data. So I'm also interested in applying statistics, machine learning and AI besides software engineering and architecture.
