<h2 id="the-entire-floor-is-waiting-for-the-error-you-made-in-the-configuration">The entire floor is waiting for the error you made in the configuration.</h2>
<blockquote>
<p>You NEED to get out of this meeting NOW because you checked something into the configuration and now the ENTIRE FLOOR is waiting for you to fix that error because the site is BROKEN.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Has this ever happened to you? Clumsy huh. Maybe also a pointer there is something wrong in an organization or an architecture. Sometimes you end up in a situation of a big ball of mud somewhere between triple-headed monolith and a distributed monolith pretending to be a microservices architecture that is difficult to disentangle. These eye-opening situations can spark some idea of what are the bottlenecks that are of great cost for the organization you are working for. At the end of this text we will try to find a way to fix this specific technical debt issue in a data driven way.</p>
<p>But first let's start with a low impact example.</p>
<h2 id="i-need-a-new-keyboard">I need a new keyboard,</h2>
<p>There is a disparity between the scale of costs between you as developer and the tooling you work with everyday. The most fundamental thing you work as a knowledge worker is usually some kind of keyboard or input device. Imagine the situation where you are giving a faulty keyboard. Let's say the defect is that due to over-usage of keys the colon and semicolon on your keyboard has become indistinguishable. This may be annoying since as a developer working typically in C-style languages your statements are usually terminated by semicolons and if you make an error while blind typing it may be more difficult to get in the flow when you try to figure out which one of the two you have to push to fix your syntax error. How do you ask your manager for a new keyboard. You could just ask but if you had those soft skills why did you become a developer in the first place.</p>
<p>One thing important to keep in mind that you are not comparing apples with oranges. That's why it's important to write down the full formula of your equation so we'll do this with \( \LaTeX \) using <a href="https://katex.org/">\( \KaTeX \)</a> so you can balance the units of measure.</p>
<p>We can use the power of the source here. You can look up the total amount of lines terminated with semicolons in your code base. Doing some <a href="http://widgetsandshit.com/teddziuba/2010/10/taco-bell-programming.html">tacobell programming</a> can help you with that task. Looking at the age of your source code repository you can estimate how much lines of code that end with semicolons are added over a time-period. If you estimate that about half of the time your are typing a colon instead of semicolon you have a proportion of time that has a chance that you are delayed by your faulty keyboard.</p>
<p>$$RateOfMistyping \frac{[NumberOfMistakes]}{[Seconds]} = \frac{1}{2} * \frac{NumberOfNewLinesEndingWithSemicolon}{AgeOfRepoSeconds}$$</p>
<p>We do not work 24/7 so we need to adjust time for that, we also roughly assume that half of our time we are writing code:</p>
<p>$$DevelopmentRatio \frac{[workseconds]}{[seconds]} =  RatioDevelopmentDuringWork \frac{1}{2} * \frac{200 \frac{[WorkDay]}{[Year]}}{365 \frac{[Day]}{[Year]}} * \frac{8\frac{[Hour]}{[Workingday]}}{24\frac{[Hour]}{[Day]}} \newline = \frac{100}{1095}  \frac{[Worktime]}{[Time]} $$</p>
<p>Since it the ratio is a ratio of two similar things measured in seconds it is in essence dimensionless.</p>
<p>We can transform these ratios into something more hands on for decision makers:</p>
<p>$$CostOfMistyping \frac{[€]}{[Workday]} = \frac{1095}{100} * RateOfMistyping * FTEdayrate  \frac{[€]}{[Workday]} \newline = \frac{1095}{200} * \frac{NumberOfNewLinesEndingWithSemicolon}{AgeOfRepoSeconds} * FTEdayrate  \frac{[€]}{[Workday]} $$</p>
<p>You can then report this to your manager and they can offset this to the cost of sourcing you a new keyboard. Using this simple formula he can calculate an earn-back period for a simple keyboard.</p>
<p>Why would this work? Why would you use such a rough estimate. I will try to counter this opposition with some more background and then we can finish with our larger problem.</p>
<h1 id="there-is-no-time-for-that">"There is no time for that":.</h1>
<p>Whatever role you are in as a technical person you are usually in a context where you are a cost center to an organization on a budget in the public sector or with a profit goal in the private sector. The only profit center for a company is possibly maybe even only a paying customer according to Peter Drucker. Or a satisfied taxpayer if you are in the public sector. Not everyone works at a FAANG/MAMAA company where you have the privilege to spend 20% on your time on "n'importe quoi" be it a hobby project or some necessary improvement. Sometimes from your expert point of view you can identify certain improvements that think would benefit your organization and maybe also look good on your CV. Usually you are managed at by somebody who does not talk in the same language like you about software architecture and engineering. You can however talk in a common language of fungible things like time or money. Unless you are a solo start-up founder and then the following is still relevant knowledge to have if you want to keep you business from running up high costs. When you are in a constrained environment you can use the below ascribed technique to negotiate budget or budgeted time to be spent on a necessary technical improvements. Here we try to show a way how to put a number on technical debt and what a return of investment would be when trying to decrease this technical debt.</p>
<p>Some managers have read the lean start-up and follow the conviction that technical debt does not exists. This is however in the assumption that one can cash-out the start-up before that and exit the business before you have to pay back on that debt. If you are not working in a start-up with a short term exit scenario you can counter that argument by quantify this debt in the long term.</p>
<h2 id="background-lean-cost-calculation">Background: lean cost calculation</h2>
<p>Usually we are working in teams where agile methodologies are used like Scrum or Kanban. These methodologies have it's roots in lean manufacturing. Software development is knowledge work and also with a lot of unknowns because of reasons like social and organizational interactions or the rapid evolution of technological tools. That's why deeply quantitative methods or calculations for extensive planning is quite taboo in opposition to the waterfall software methodology. We mostly use the methodology of Kanban by using story points or t-shirts sizes that have no direct link to quantities of time. Kanban has it's origin in a three-bin system or other physical tokens which were added to half-products for a workstation and the return of physical token to the stock was a trigger to replenish that workstation. These tokens were an indirect way to measure the physical flow of materials.</p>
<h3 id="kaizen-event-a-one-time-hackathon-for-quality">Kaizen event: a one-time hackathon for quality</h3>
<p>Another tool in the toolbox of lean manufacturing is the Kaizen event. The purpose of this not to monitor the stability of quality continuously but rather it is literally a focused event to improve your process dramatically in a short timespan. In a manufacturing environment this could be a shopfloor or warehouse manager focusing one certain operation in collaboration with the operators on the floor. This is done in a single DMAIC cycle. This has different steps where you Define your objective to improve on, Measure an indicator for that objective, Analyze this measurement, Improve on this indicator and Control for this improvement. It's a bit like a hackathon but in a production environment and the purpose is not necessarily trying something new or innovative but to specifically improve quality.</p>
<p>Another concept that is helpful here is looking at wastes (named Muda in lean terminology based on Japanese) in your process that could be useful in choosing a metric for the measurement phase. For manufacturing Muda are classified under the mnemonic TIMWOODS which stands for Transportation, Inventory, Motion, Waiting, Overproduction, Over processing, Defects and Skills which is pretty self-explanatory.</p>
<h3 id="back-of-the-envelope-calculation-a-guesstimation">Back of the envelope calculation: a guesstimation</h3>
<p>To define your metric it is possible to do back of the envelope calculations to estimate any of these potential wastes. If you are not familiar with them there is a <a href="https://anchor.fm/breakingmathpodcast/episodes/P9-Give-or-Take-Back-of-the-Envelope-Estimates--Fermi-Problems-ev6tlf">good introduction</a> for this in the breaking math podcast. This a skill that is sometimes tested by large companies in the hiring process. There is a talk by Jeff Dean that shows how they use this method at Google to make the right choices when writing code based on latency numbers:</p>
<p><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=modXC5IWTJI"><img src="https://img.youtube.com/vi/modXC5IWTJI/0.jpg" alt="google talk by Jeff Dean" /></a></p>
<p>This may seem crude but you may be familiar with the pareto principle which says that 20% of a system has 80% impact and the 80% is negligible in some cases. This idea is even more fundamental than only in economics where Pareto discovered that 20% of the people owned 80% of the wealth. Similarly you have perturbation theory where you solve a simple problem exactly to approximate a complex problem. Feynman diagrams to model complex quantum mechanical interactions between fundamental particles are based on perturbation theory:</p>
<p><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oQ1WZ-eJW8Y"><img src="https://img.youtube.com/vi/oQ1WZ-eJW8Y/0.jpg" alt="perturbation theory Space Time" /></a></p>
<p>Even more fundamentally this idea of a small proportion explaining a large part by approximation can by found in information theory with the Zipf-distribution which is covered here by Vsauce:</p>
<p><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fCn8zs912OE"><img src="https://img.youtube.com/vi/fCn8zs912OE/0.jpg" alt="vsause zipf" /></a></p>
<h3 id="measuring-economies-of-scale-of-development-use-the-source">Measuring economies of scale of development: use the source</h3>
<p>To get more concretely on what to try to measure you may ask yourself what can I measure to put a figure on my technical debt. Here the late Peter Hintjes dropped a clue in his free e-book  <a href="https://content.cultureandempire.com/index.html">Culture and Empire</a> that products of technological innovation have a deflationary pressure on them as a generalization on Moore's law.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>I've observed that Moore's Law applies to much more than silicon: it applies to all technology, and always has applied. I call this general law "cost gravity": the production cost of technology drops by half every 24 months, more or less. Ignoring materials, labor, distribution, marketing, and sales, the cost of any given technology will eventually approach zero.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>The essence of automation is scalability which means you try to make unit costs of things like physical items or human tasks negligible. This leads to the disparity that I mentioned the first concrete example. As a low level knowledge worker almost the only resource you have impact on is how you apply your labor. Estimating time during a planning phase directly is somewhat taboo in agile methodologies as mentioned early since knowledge work is rather unpredictable. Software development is in essence a human job. This is nicely illustrated in the book <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Peopleware:_Productive_Projects_and_Teams">Peopleware: Productive Projects and Teams</a> which puts forward measuring flow time of knowledge workers. Flow time is the amount of time you can work uninterrupted. However not all tasks that a developer does is knowledge work but rather repeatable. To ensure stability and quality of software products we have CI/CD processes which includes source control and build automation. Analyzing these sources of information on your daily tasks is not an entirely new idea. <a href="https://github.com/adamtornhill/code-maat">Adam Tornhill</a> has written numerous book about using source control as a data source on how to measure hotspots of possible technical debt:</p>
<p><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fl4aZ2KXBsQ"><img src="https://img.youtube.com/vi/fl4aZ2KXBsQ/0.jpg" alt="Adam Tornhill technical debt" /></a></p>
<h2 id="back-to-our-first-example-the-entire-floor-is-waiting-for-the-error-you-made-in-the-configuration">Back to our first example: The entire floor is waiting for the error you made in the configuration.</h2>
<p>So we fixed the configuration error and everybody is back at work. Some people would do the easy fix and continue with their day. If you care about the bottom line of the organization you are working for maybe you are inclined to investigate further this blocking issue. Since "Waiting" is one of the Lean Muda we will focus on optimizing the cost of the waiting time of your colleagues. Mo' services mo' problems and a solution to distributed configuration in microservices is the principle of control plane in a service mesh. More concretely we will take a stab at Consul as control plane as an alternative for checking configurations into source control and running it through a CI/CD pipeline tied to a monolith.</p>
<p>Again we can use the power of the source. Since all configuration is checked in under one folder in the monolith we can use the power of the source to lookup how many changes were done to that folder.</p>
<pre style="background-color:#2b303b;color:#c0c5ce;"><code><span>git log -- path/to/configfolder/*
</span></code></pre>
<p>Surely a modern organization is using git by now ;). Again we can also look at the first commit date and last commit date to estimate the time your colleagues have been working in this configuration folder. A simple sample estimation of build and deployment of the monolith can give us a rough estimate of one hour for each step getting a configuration change into a live environment. Since the entire floor was waiting on you during the wrong configuration change you can assume at least one developer is idling for your change to go live (Let alone a tester, business owner or god forbid an actual end user). With this knowledge we get a rough estimate of the operation expenses of using configuration tied to the monolith.</p>
<p>First we estimate the number of config changes per workday:
$$NumberOfConfigChangesPerWorkDay \frac{[ConfigChange]}{[Workday]}  \newline = \frac{1095}{200} [Worktimeratio] * 60 \frac{[Seconds]}{[Minute]} * 60 \frac{[Minute]}{[Hour]} * 24 \frac{[Hour]}{[Day]}  \newline * \frac{NumberOfConfigChangesSinceStartRepo [ConfigChange]}{AgeOfRepo[Seconds]} $$</p>
<p>Then we estimate the daily cost for the configchanges via the old buildsystem:
$$CostPerWorkDay \frac{[€]}{[Workday]} = NumberOfConfigChangesPerWorkDay \frac{[ConfigChange]}{[Workday]} \newline * 1 \frac{[Workhour]}{[ConfigChange]} * \frac{1}{8} \frac{[Workday]}{[Workhour]} * FTEdayrate  \frac{[€]}{[Workday]}$$</p>
<p>$$CostPerWorkDay \frac{[€]}{[Workday]} = \frac{1095}{200} * 60 * 60 * 24 * \frac{1}{8} \newline * \frac{NumberOfConfigChangesSinceStartRepo [ConfigChange]}{AgeOfRepo[Seconds]}  *  FTEdayrate  * \frac{[€]}{[Workday]} $$</p>
<p>For the cross cutting concern of configuration management we might consider a solution like Consul by Hashicorp. The operational expense (OPEX) of this solution is negligible compared to the legacy 1-hour build-time. This can easily be simulated <a href="https://www.serf.io/docs/internals/simulator.html">here</a> with a webtool by Hashicorp that config changes can be distributed in sub second timeframes. The setup of Consul is rather simple and easy to build an MVP within your organization. Let's consider that you timebox the research into setting Consul to 1 FTE for one scrum sprint of 2 weeks and consider that licensing costs for open source software is a free lunch and hardware cost are negligible compared to the developer cost we can do a rough estimate of the initial investment or CAPEX for the replacement architecture as just the day rate of you as an FTE.</p>
<p>That way we can estimate an ROI calculation on this investment on improving on this technical debt versus letting the current architecture and process running:</p>
<p>First we can do a rough estimate of keeping the architectural debt running for one year.</p>
<p>$$YearlyCost = CostPerWorkDay \frac{[€]}{[Workday]} * 200 \frac{[Workday]}{[Year]} $$</p>
<p>When we do an investment analysis we want to compare the investment versus the cost cutting. So the Return On Investment in a one year technical investment decision is:</p>
<p>$$ ROI =  \frac{YearlyCost}{InitialInvestment} = \frac{YearlyCost}{FTEdayrate * 10 ScrumSprintWorkingDays} $$</p>
<p>If we would write in full the YearlyCost we may realize that the FTE day-rate is both in the numerator and denominator of the ROI estimation. This is an important point that the investment can be analyzed on a purely time based accounting method to estimate a ROI. FTE day-rates may be a sensitive topic in any organization so it may make some conversations easier. But you may give the yearly cost formula to a decisionmaker to drive home the argument that the technical debt is actually costing to the organization and let them fill in the blanks. Or come back with a more refined counter argument to why the cost may not be of that order of magnitude. But that is at least better than pretending that technical debt does not exist.</p>
<h2 id="conclusion-how-many-developers-does-it-take-to-turn-in-a-light-bulb">Conclusion: how many developers does it take to turn in a light bulb</h2>
<p>To conclude this article we learned the following things.</p>
<ul>
<li>*Technical debt can be proven to exist by roughly estimating it.</li>
<li>*Order of magnitudes and back of the envelope estimation may be used to do more data driven decision making on technical debt fixing.</li>
<li>*Learning to balancing equations using units of measures is important to not compare apples to oranges.</li>
<li>*In software we can reduce a lot of reasoning about thinking about costs to the cost of ourselves as employee as tool builders as our tools come with enormous economies of scale.</li>
<li>*Use the source and the worklog like system to get a rough estimate of different ways technical debt are impacting the bottom-line of your organization.</li>
<li>*ROI estimations can be done purely on a developer time base, costs can be a presented as a part of developer time and converted to money terms. Money and time are fungible concepts which a decision maker may understand compared to extremely technical topics that would be hard to explain.</li>
